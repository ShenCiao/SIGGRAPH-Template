\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedWork}

Cite all relevant works, and how yours stands on the shoulder of these previous giants.
Use a bibtex file such as \filename{paper.bib} and you can cite relevant works such as \cite{Sun:2016:MVP}.

I usually write into \Cref{sec:relatedWork} immediately after I read each paper so that I can record the key points while my memory is still fresh, and organize papers into groups when there are enough written there to identify common themes.
It is very common for me to rewrite after the positioning of the project becomes clearer, but the materials here always help.
